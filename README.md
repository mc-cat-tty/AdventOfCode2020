Advent of Code 2020 Python solutions :christmas_tree: :santa:

## Notes
To speed development up I tried to apply TDD - Test Driven Development -

Keep 2 windows opened side by side (e.g.):
```
vim day3_1.py
```
and
```
watch -n 1 -d 'cat input3 | python3 day3_1.py'
```

This way, `watch` will keep the script results updated (remember to save with `ESC :w` to apply changes) and you'll notice when the algorithm is right

Tip: try your solution against the examples given in the puzzle
